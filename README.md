# Employee Management System
Created by Daniel Eleam, Jax Pendergrass, Alex Pruitt, Blaine Seaman, Damian Tucker, and Sadie Young
## Purpose
The Employee Management System is a web application built with Flask, designed to manage employee information, schedules, and payroll. It allows administrators to manage employee records, add or delete shifts, and generate pay stubs. Employees can view their schedules and pay slips, and submit time-off requests.

## Requirements
Latest version of Python and pip.

## Execution
Make sure there is no antivirus or any other type of block/firewall preventing your computer from executing scripts.<br><br>
This program runs in venv, a virtual environment for Python. A batch file (Windows) and a shell script (MAC/Linux) is provided to run all the setup automatically.<br><br>
If you are using through Github, follow the instructions below and then proceed to the 'For Windows' or 'For MAC/Linux' sections. If you already have the files, make sure you are in the correct directory and proceed straight to the instructions for your OS.<br><br>
### Github
To run the application, clone the repository into your chosen directory using:<br><br>
`git clone https://github.com/damiant2002/CS421-Project.git`<br><br>
then access the directory with:<br><br>
`cd CS421-Project`<br><br>
Proceed to the instructions for your OS below.<br><br>

### For Windows
Find files in file explorer and double-click run_flask_windows.<br><br>
Alternatively:<br>

In powershell, run: <br><br>
`./run_flask_windows.bat`<br><br>
or<br><br>
`run_flask_windows.bat`<br><br>
in the command prompt. <br><br>

### For MAC/Linux
Run `chmod +x run_flask.sh` to make sure user has permission to execute. (We had to do this in CodeSpaces)

Run `./run_flask.sh` or `run_flask.sh` in the terminal.

The program will then open in your default browser.<br><br>
