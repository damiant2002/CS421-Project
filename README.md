# Employee Management System
Created by Daniel Eleam, Jax Pendergrass, Alex Pruitt, Blaine Seaman, Damian Tucker, and Sadie Young
## Purpose
The Employee Management System is a web application built with Flask, designed to manage employee information, schedules, and payroll. It allows administrators to manage employee records, add or delete shifts, and generate pay stubs. Employees can view their schedules and pay slips, and submit time-off requests.

## Requirements
Latest version of Python.

## Execution
To run the application, clone the repository into your chosen directory using:
`git clone https://github.com/damiant2002/CS421-Project.git`
then access the directory with:
`cd CS421-Project`

### For Windows
In powershell, run: 
`./run_flask.bat`
or
`run_flask.bat`
in the command prompt.

### For MAC/Linux
Run `chmod +x run_flask.sh` to make sure user has permission to execute. (We had to do this in CodeSpaces)

Run `./run_flask.sh` or `run_flask.sh` in the terminal.

The program will then open in your default browser.
